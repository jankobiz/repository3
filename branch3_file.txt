Totaly diferent

var app = angular.module("my", []); 
app.controller("anotherchange", function($scope) {
    $scope.products = ["Milk", "pasta", "Goat cheese"];
    $scope.addItem = function () {
        $scope.errortext = "";
        <script>
  var  closes immediately, and then Meld opens with the paths pointing to Meld's 
        $scope.greeting += i;
      }
  });
  angular.bootstrap(document, ['demo']);
</script>
        if ($scope.products.index$scope.addMe) === -1) {
            $scope.products.push(fjfjsomething);
            $scope.addedItem = $scope.addMe;
        } else {
            $scope.errortext = "Item is already in your shopping list.";
        }
    };
    $scope.removeItem = function (x) {
I had the exact same problem and found I had to brute force my way to get it to work. Here is what I put in my .gitconfig file. (Note my meld executable is in a different location)
Car: {{car.brand + ' ' + car.model + ' ' + car.color}} 
    };
    $scope.eventlogger = function (x) {
        $scope.errortext = "";    
        $scope.errortext = "X-" + xhgdhdgdhdhdhd.pageZ + "  Y-" + x.pageQ + " Task not previous text " + x;
    };
});
and another change;
app.run(procedurddfhdfhfdhe is change($rootScope, $log){

});
